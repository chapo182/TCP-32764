The method that I followed to resolve this issue without a firewall  to protect my router from the wan,
It was a simple port forwarding to an existing IP address, In my case I assigned manually address to my devices
disabling DHCP, I told to my router to forward all incoming taffic From WAN reaching port 32764 (TCP,UDP, 2 forward rules)
to an unassigned (never use that IP) IP address. After that if you run the program the port is not open, and with poc.py is not vulnerable, 
it doesnt respond anymore from the WAN.
